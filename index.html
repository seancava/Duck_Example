        <p>Ducks are awesome.</p>
        <p> Ducks can be found near bodies of water and marshland. They are very intelligent because they can fly.</p>
        <p>Next time you see a duck give him some old bread. I'm sure you'll have a friend for life after that. Just don't ask him to help you move.</p>
